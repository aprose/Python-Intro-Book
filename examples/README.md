# Example Projects and Code

This directory contains practical examples and mini-projects to demonstrate concepts from the book.

## Available Examples

### 1. Simple Neural Network (`simple_neural_network.py`)
A from-scratch implementation of a 2-layer neural network solving the XOR problem.

**What you'll learn:**
- Forward and backward propagation
- Gradient descent optimization
- Binary classification

**How to run:**
```bash
python simple_neural_network.py
```

### 2. Image Classification with CNN (Coming Soon)
Build a convolutional neural network for image classification using PyTorch or TensorFlow.

### 3. Text Generation with RNN (Coming Soon)
Implement a recurrent neural network for character-level text generation.

### 4. Sentiment Analysis (Coming Soon)
Use deep learning for natural language processing to classify text sentiment.

### 5. GAN for Image Generation (Coming Soon)
Create synthetic images using Generative Adversarial Networks.

## Running the Examples

1. Make sure you have installed all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt
```

2. Navigate to this directory:
```bash
cd examples
```

3. Run any example:
```bash
python example_name.py
```

## Creating Your Own Projects

Use these examples as templates for your own projects:
1. Copy an example file
2. Modify it for your specific use case
3. Experiment with different parameters
4. Try different datasets

## Tips

- Start with simpler examples before moving to complex ones
- Read the code comments to understand each section
- Experiment with hyperparameters
- Use print statements to debug
- Visualize results when possible

## Contributing
